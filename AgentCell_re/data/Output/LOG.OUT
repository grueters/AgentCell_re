Optimising the reaction matrix...
The time increment has been optimised. Every iteration represents 4.93e-08 seconds.
202739000495 iterations (10000.00 simulation seconds) will be performed.
Complex Type levels will be dumped only at the beginning and end of the simulation.
Variable values will be stored every 202739 iterations (0.01 simulation seconds).
The simulation will take approximately 17889.69 seconds to complete.

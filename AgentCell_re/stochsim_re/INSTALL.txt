Installation
************

Move the distribution directory to the convenient place (for instance 
/usr/local/lib under Unices or \"program files"\ on MS Windows). 

Version 1.4 of the program is split into four parts. However each of the
four archives contains a directory "stochsim", itself divided according to the
same set of subdirectories.

In the subdirectory "bin" of the distribution there are several executable named 
"stochsim_xxxx". Rename the one relevant to your operating system "stochsim". 
(Win32 users can of course rename the file stochsim.exe)

The files "tkstochsim.pl" and "stochsim" present in the subdirectory "bin" of the 
distribution have to be located in a directory present in your path. Either 
copy the programs to such a directory, or add the directory "bin" of the 
distribution to your path, or even make a link (a shortcut) from a directory 
present in your path. 

If you plan to use StochSim with AgentCell, please follow the installation instructions
provided in the README file of the AgentCell distribution

StochSim core
=============

The stochsim core is already pre-compiled. However, if you want to compile it 
specifically for your environment (which is an excellent idea by the way), move
to the directory "src", and type 

PROMPT> make.

To remove the temporary object files, type 

PROMPT> make clean

Move the resulting stochsim executable in the "bin" directory of the distribution. 

Some examples of configuration files are present in the subdirectory
"config_examples". If you use StochSim directly (rather than throught the
graphical user interface) you have to launch the program from the adequate
"Input" subdirectory, for instance:

cd /usr/local/lib/stochsim/config_examples/LotkaVoltera/Input
stochsim

Notes on wrapping the core application:
--------------------------------------

If you wish to use StochSim as a "wrapped" object in other programs,
you can use the "SSWrapper" class interface provided in the core
distribution.  The makefile now contains routines for compiling a
shared object library ("libstochsim.so" - a pre-compiled version for
linux is provided in the lib/linux_i386 directory) that you can
dynamically link to from your application at runtime.  Just ensure
that libstochsim.so is somewhere in your linker's search path (e.g. by
setting its location in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable on
Linux systems).  For more information on this interface, see the
comments in SSWrapper.hh in the src directory.

Perl/Tk interface
=================

The Perl/Tk interface requires Perl 5.004 and Perl/Tk 800.022. You can find
them in the CPAN (e.g. http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/README.html). MS
Windows users would maybe prefer the ActiveState distribution, claimed to
be simpler to install and maintain (http://www.activestate.com/). In such a
case, download and install the current ActiveSate distribution. Then install
the module Tk: 

1) You have a direct access to the internet from the computer where StochSim
is to be installed:

Launch the programme ppm (present in the directory Perl/bin)
Type "install Tk". (You can type "search Tk" to assess that you have access
to a repository containing the proper archive).
That's it.

2) You do not have a direct access to the internet from the computer where 
StochSim is to be installed:

Get the file Tk.ppd (http://www.activestate.com/PPMPackages/5.6/) and put 
it in a temporary directory, let's say c:\windows\temp
Get the file tk.tar.gz (http://www.activestate.com/PPMPackages/5.6/x86/)
and put it in c:\windows\temp\x86
Launch the programme ppm (present in the directory Perl/bin)
Type "set repository HERE c:\windows\temp"
Type "install Tk". (You can type "search Tk" to assess that you have access
to a repository containing the proper archive).
That's it.

(NB: the SBML export is performed by XM::Simple, which is included in the 
distribution of Stochsim. However XML::Simple in turn depends on XML::parser,
which is not included. According to your Perl installation, you could also 
need to install this package).

Setup the environment variable "STOCHSIM" to the main directory of the stochsim
distribution. Under Unices put the following line in the proper configuration 
file (/etc/profile for a system installation, and for a personnal installation
.bashrc, .bash_profile or .profile). Note that the actual directory can be 
different:

export STOCHSIM=/usr/local/lib/stochsim        # if you use bash
or
setenv STOCHSIM /usr/local/lib/stochsim        # if you use csh

under DOS or Windows, you can add the following line in the file 
"c:\autoexec.bat":

set STOCHSIM=c:\"program files"\stochsim

Under Unix-like environment, you can move the content of the subdirectory "doc"
to /usr/doc/stochsim for instance. However A copy of stochsim_manual.pdf has 
to be kept in the directory $STOCHSIM/doc (or a link to the actual 
stochsim_manual.pdf present in /usr/doc/stochsim).

To launch TkStochSim, just type "tkstochsim.pl" or "perl tkstochsim.pl".

If you use TkStochSim for the first time, a directory ".stochsim" will be 
created in your HOME directory. The file "stochsimrc" of the distribution
will be copied in ".stochsim". If you upgrade TkStochSim, you already have
a ".stochsim" directory with a file "stochsimrc". The format of the file 
"stochsimrc" could have changed. You should therefore copy the file "stochsimrc"
present in the directory "lib" of the distribution in you ".stochsim" directory
and edit it.

# The following colors can be defined by odes names such as "#FF0000" or "#153D4F" 
# the '#' means hexadecimal. The following digits are the specification of the 
# color by its Red Green Blue content, each value between 0 and 255, i.e. 00 to
# FF in hexadecimal. Some common colors:
# black       = #000000
# white       = #FFFFFF
# red         = #FF0000
# light green = #00FF00
# blue        = #0000FF
# yellow      = #FFFF00  (red + green)
# cyan        = #00FFFF  (green + blue)
# orange      = #FFAA00  (red + light green
# gray        = #AFAFAF
# dark green  = #009900

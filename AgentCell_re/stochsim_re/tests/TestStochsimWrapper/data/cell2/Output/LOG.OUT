Optimising the reaction matrix...
The time increment has been optimised. Every iteration represents 4.93e-08 seconds.
8109560 iterations (0.40 simulation seconds) will be performed.
Complex Type levels will be dumped every 2027390004 iterations (100.00 simulation seconds).
Variable values will be stored every 202739 iterations (0.01 simulation seconds).
The simulation will take approximately 0.50 seconds to complete.
The value {asp*} has been changed in iteration 0.
The value {asp} has been changed in iteration 0.
